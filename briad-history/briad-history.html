                they were originally bred to herd as well as guard flocks of sheep. And they were often left to their
                own devices in order to accomplish their assigned tasks. This makes the Briad different from those
                breeds that only guard and those that only herd. The breeds that just herd are often smaller in size,
                agile, and swift of foot. Those breeds that just guard are usually larger and heavier. Briards were used
                in all types of herding situations, having the ability to learn many commands and fulfill the jobs
                expected of them. The Briard was most commonly used as a farm dog in the more crowded farming valleys of
                France, where row crops were grown. Sheep were allowed to graze the grass strips between crops and
                Briards were responsible for keeping the sheep moving along these strips, and preventing the sheep from
                eating the crops. The Briard moved the sheep daily from the farm to ghe graze areas and back again at
                night.
